  Here are some examples of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
  ### Basic Example
  ```hcl
      module "alarm" {
        source                    = "clouddrove/cloudwatch-alarms/aws"
        version                   = "1.0.1"
        name                      = "alarm"
        environment               = "test"
        label_order               = ["name", "environment"]
        alarm_name                = "cpu-alarm"
        comparison_operator       = "LessThanThreshold"
        evaluation_periods        = 2
        metric_name               = "CPUUtilization"
        namespace                 = "AWS/EC2"
        period                    = "60"
        statistic                 = "Average"
        threshold                 = "40"
        alarm_description         = "This metric monitors ec2 cpu utilization"
        alarm_actions             = ["arn:aws:sns:eu-west-1:xxxxxxxxxxx:test"]
        actions_enabled           = true
        insufficient_data_actions = []
        ok_actions                = []
        dimensions                = {
                      instance_id = "i-xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
        }
    }
  ```

  ### Anomaly Example
  ```hcl
      module "alarm" {
        source                    = "clouddrove/cloudwatch-alarms/aws"

        name                      = "alarm"
        environment               = "test"
        label_order               = ["name", "environment"]
        alarm_name                = "cpu-alarm"
        comparison_operator       = "GreaterThanUpperThreshold"
        evaluation_periods        = 2
        threshold_metric_id       = "e1"
        query_expressions         = [{
