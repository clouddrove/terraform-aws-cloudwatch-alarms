We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 

- [Terraform 1.x.x](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-cloudwatch-alarms/releases).


Here are some examples of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
### Basic Example
```hcl
    module "alarm" {
      source                    = "clouddrove/cloudwatch-alarms/aws"
      version                   = "1.0.1"
      name                      = "alarm"
      environment               = "test"
      label_order               = ["name", "environment"]
      alarm_name                = "cpu-alarm"
      comparison_operator       = "LessThanThreshold"
      evaluation_periods        = 2
      metric_name               = "CPUUtilization"
      namespace                 = "AWS/EC2"
      period                    = "60"
      statistic                 = "Average"
      threshold                 = "40"
      alarm_description         = "This metric monitors ec2 cpu utilization"
      alarm_actions             = ["arn:aws:sns:eu-west-1:xxxxxxxxxxx:test"]
      actions_enabled           = true

## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
